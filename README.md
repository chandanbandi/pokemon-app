This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Pokemon App

This app is built on react as javascript framework and bootstrap as css framework. I have demonstrated list of pokemons from the Pokeapi(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon) and illustrated in a neat card component.
